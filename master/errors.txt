* syntax error
  
  This link text is empty:
  
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/3GxK1kjxUmZKl23x6nEY"></a>
  
  Note that the syntax for links in Markdown is
  
      [link text](URL)
  
  For the internal links (where URL starts with "#"), then the documentation
  system can fill in the title automatically, leading to the format:
  
      [](#other-section)
  
  However, this does not work for external sites, such as:
  
      [](https://www.dropbox.com/request/3GxK1kjxUmZKl23x6nEY)
  
  So, you need to provide some text, such as:
  
      [this useful website](https://www.dropbox.com/request/3GxK1kjxUmZKl23x6nEY)[0m[0m
