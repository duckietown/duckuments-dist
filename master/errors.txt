* syntax error
  
  This link is empty:
  
      <a class="number_name" href="#booktitle"></a>
  
  It might be that the writer intended for this
  link to point to something, but they got the syntax wrong.
  
      href = #booktitle
  
  As a reminder, to refer to other parts of the document, use
  the syntax "#ID", such as:
  
      See [](#fig:my-figure).
  
      See [](#section-name).[0m[0m
