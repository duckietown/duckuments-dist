<h2>Spurious file</h2>
<p>This file is a spurious remain from earlier compilation.</p>

<p>If you are reached this file, it means that somebody is not using PURLs 
to link to parts of the duckiebook.</p>

<p>Maybe try this link to find the version on master (no guarantees): <a href="http://purl.org/dt/master/demo-navigation-057-25_navigation-f8d3994f">http://purl.org/dt/master/demo-navigation-057-25_navigation-f8d3994f</a></p>
<p>If that does not work, the section was renamed.</p>
